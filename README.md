# Nodemcu-dht-to-signalk
Implementation of signalK enabled temperature and humidity sensor DHT22 on esp8266

Flash the esp8266 with the lua files from this repository, 
and the DHT library from https://github.com/javieryanez/nodemcu-modules/blob/master/dht22/dht22_min.lua

The ESP8266 is quite finnicky, , but by compiling the main lua script, it runs well
